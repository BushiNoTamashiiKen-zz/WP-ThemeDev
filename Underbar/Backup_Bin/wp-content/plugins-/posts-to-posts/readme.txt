Create connections between posts

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create relationships between posts of different types. The relationships are stored in a hidden taxonomy.

To register a connection between two post types, write:

`
function my_connection_types() {
	if ( !function_exists('p2p_register_connection_type') )
		return;

	p2p_register_connection_type('book', 'author');
	p2p_register_connection_type('library', 'book');
}
add_action('init', 'my_connection_types', 100);
`
<br>

See [available functions](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/posts-to-posts/tags/0.3/api.php).


== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:
